# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
Bid Data, using colab, pandas, RDS, AWS

1.  Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
  
  The purpose for the deliverable 2 is to retrieve information througth the use of PySpark, Pandas y PgAdmin. 
In the case of PySpark que had to make a conncetion to AWS to extract our data base, so all the work made was online. Secondly, while using Pandas in jupyter notebook we import the data base from AWS to our computer so the data base can be loaded in jupyter. And thirdth using PgAdmin a daba base was created but it wasnÂ´t related to aws, I mean, we create the data base locally so we have to create the tables using some queries and then populate the data base importing our local data base.
  
While using each tool to manage the data base, this challenge asked to retrieve some data frames, or tables in order to know some information like:   
 

2.  Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

+ How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
+ How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
+ What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

3.  Summary: In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
